 - Security hotspots: security-sensitive areas of code that require manual review .

 **Benefits**

 - Improved code maintainability .

 - Enhanced reliability .

- security assurance .

- Integration .

 1. Developers push code to a code repo.

 2. SonarQube Scanner fetches the code for analysis 

 3. code analysis is performed , and results are sent to the SonarQube server .
 
 4. SonarQube server processes the results , applies rules and stores data in the database .

 5. Comprehensive reports and metrics are generated for continuous monitoring and improvment .

**Installation:**
